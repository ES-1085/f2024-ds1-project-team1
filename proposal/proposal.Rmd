## 1. Introduction

Our dataset comes from a database called Kaggle that provides a handful of climate datasets that are free to download. 

## 2. Data

Text goes here.

```{r importing_data}
natural_disasters <- read.csv(file = "../data/DCS_Project.csv")
```

## 3. Data analysis plan

In this project, we are looking specifically at how the severity of natural disasters has changed over the last century(1900-2000). 


```{r printing-natural-diaster-dataset}
print(natural_disasters)
```


## 4. Data Ethics Review

The data ethics review section will be introduced in a separate class and is not part of the original proposal deadline.
